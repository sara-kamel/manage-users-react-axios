# manage-users-react-axios


## Project Overview

This project is a user management interface built using React. It leverages Axios for API calls to mockAPI (mockapi.io) to simulate backend operations. This setup demonstrates the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a user database, showcasing practical API integration skills with React.

### Features

- **Create**: Add new users to the system.
- **Read**: View all users registered in the system.
- **Update**: Edit details of existing users.
- **Delete**: Remove users from the system.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: Promise based HTTP client for making API calls.
- **mockAPI.io**: Service used to create a simulated backend that supports CRUD operations.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive framework for building user interfaces with ready-to-use components.
